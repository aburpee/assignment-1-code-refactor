## Description:  

The goal of this assignment is to improve the readability and accessibility of both the html document and the css styles sheet. Search Engine Optimization uses accessibility as a parameter that improves searchability.   

## User Story  
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessbiility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I view the source code  
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
* WHEN I view the image elements  
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
* WHEN I view the heading attributes  
- THEN they fall in sequential order 
* WHEN I view the title element  
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
